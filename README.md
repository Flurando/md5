# TODO

- examine the code carefully according to the rfc to check where my logic is wrong
- rewrite part first to bring ABCD into lexical content rather than global
- make the program easy to rerun instead of reloading every time
- write test suites for each part

# HELP NEEDED

Super gratitude for anyone telling me how to tweat my code to produce the right answer.
