# md5

The only working version is the newmd5.scm file which is written according to wikipedia and a python implementation on Rosetta Code website.



Other files doesn't work and meantime I have piles of homework to do, leaving little motivation to recheck my initial attempt (I briefly understands that the problem lays in the Endianness that is different all through the md5 algorithm, but fixing that is not on my roadmap in the short period ahead since I have already managed to get the newmd5.scm right

However, this repo won't be archived by me.

But I think I won't come back until I came up with better or clearer implementation thought, like how to implement using bytevector ports or even bit stream (I know that is not practical but fun anyway) to work on infinite large buffer stream instead of reading everything into memory, and at that time if really happens
I would likely clean things up in this repo first.
